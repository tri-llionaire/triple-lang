TRIPLE-LANG
===========
Currently being updated to include the whole TRIPLE language, one of my own.
Transpiled by Python 2.
Built by Tristan Price.

For example:

`PUT Hello, world!`

would return:

`Hello, world!`

while most other commands like

`5 LSS 3`

would return 

`False`

and 

`5 ADD 3`

would return 

`8`
